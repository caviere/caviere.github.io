# Introduction
Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my name is Weddy from Kenya. I am currently an outreachy participant, working on the Zarr project, _"Testing the support and interoperability of Zarr Zip Stores_" A brief rundown of my interests vary from coding to watching a good heart wrenching tv show. The duality of a woman they say.

# Core Values
#### Growth
I try to challenge myself in all aspects of my life. The big leap I took was to dip my toes in programming coming from a finance and accounting background. Quite challenging Iâ€™ll tell you that but Iâ€™m still here, learning and enjoying every bit of it.

#### Curiosity
My simple take on life is that life is about being curious, exploring and seeking novelty. If I wasnâ€™t curious, life would be meaningless and this value has been helping me achieve my goal in life which is to deliver products that have a positive impact in peopleâ€™s lives.

# What motivated me to apply to Outreachy
Having no clear direction on how and where to start my new found career path, I reached out to a friend who introduced me to outreachy which led me to open source and the beautiful community that is Zarr. I am grateful for the opportunity and can't wait to see what Zarr has in store for me!
